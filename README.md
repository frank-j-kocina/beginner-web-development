# Beginner Web Development

This list of tutorials and books assumes zero knowledge of web development.
These materials are listed in the order, from top to bottom, that I think makes the most sense.
I have frontloaded it with crash course type videos that explain a lot in a very short time and have listed free books that go more in depth later on.
Don't get discouraged if you don't understand it right away or feel overwhelmed.
I just want to get the concepts out there right away and then go back in more detail with the books.

## Interactive Web Development Courses
* [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) - I went through a few of the lessons and think this is much better than Codecademy. This would be great to go through after watching the front end crash course videos to reinforce the concepts there.

## Tool Set and Miscellaneous Tech

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea) - We do most of our coding in IntelliJ. There is a 30 day free trial on the ultimate edition. It is kind of overkill for learning, but would be good to get familiar with.
