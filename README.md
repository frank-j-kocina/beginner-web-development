# Beginner Web Development

This list of tutorials and books assumes zero knowledge of web development.
These materials are listed in the order, from top to bottom, that I think makes the most sense.
I have frontloaded it with crash course type videos that explain a lot in a very short time and have listed free books that go more in depth later on.
Don't get discouraged if you don't understand it right away or feel overwhelmed.
I just want to get the concepts out there right away and then go back in more detail with the books.
