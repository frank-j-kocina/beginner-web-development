# Beginner Web Development

This guide assumes zero knowledge of web development.
I would recommend starting by downloading the tools below and using them as you learn.
Once you've got the tools, you can start watching the front end videos from top to bottom.
It will definitely help if you pause the videos as you go and try to code along with them.
After you've gotten through the videos, check out Free Code Camp for interactive tutorials.
If you have specific questions, check the docs, Google, or reach out to us.
At this point you'll hopefully have a basic understanding of front end web technology.
If you'd like to go more in depth, I've provided a free online book for each technology.
When you're ready to move on, follow the same process with the back end tech section.
We use many more technologies than I have listed here, but these are the ones we spend most of our time on.
If you have any questions along the way, feel free to reach out to us.
We want this to be a mutually beneficial internship.
We hope that you'll add value to our team and come out of this with a huge boost in web development experience.

## Tool Set and Miscellaneous Tech

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea) - We do most of our coding in IntelliJ. There is a 30 day free trial on the ultimate edition. It is kind of overkill for learning, but would be good to get familiar with.

### Source Control Management
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - We use Git for source control. Most of us just use this command line interface. The docs page and quick reference guide of this site will tell you all you'd ever want to know about Git and more.
* [GitHub](https://desktop.github.com/) Our source is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and they provide a desktop application which might be easier to begin with than the Git CLI.

### Database Management
* [DbVisualizer](https://www.dbvis.com/), [Sequl Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/) - Some of us use DbVisualizer and others use Sequel Pro. I find DbVisualizer to be more intuitive and easier to work with.

## Interactive Web Development Courses

* [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) - I went through a few of the lessons and think this is much better than Codecademy. This would be great to go through after watching the front end crash course videos to reinforce the concepts there.
