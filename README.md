# Beginner Web Development

This guide assumes zero knowledge of web development.
I would recommend starting by downloading the tools below and using them as you learn.
Once you've got the tools, you can start watching the front end videos from top to bottom.
It will definitely help if you pause the videos as you go and try to code along with them.
After you've gotten through the videos, check out Free Code Camp for interactive tutorials.
At this point you'll hopefully have a basic understanding of front end web technology.
If you'd like to go more in depth, I've provided a free online book for each technology.

## Interactive Web Development Courses

* [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) - I went through a few of the lessons and think this is much better than Codecademy. This would be great to go through after watching the front end crash course videos to reinforce the concepts there.

## Tool Set and Miscellaneous Tech

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea) - We do most of our coding in IntelliJ. There is a 30 day free trial on the ultimate edition. It is kind of overkill for learning, but would be good to get familiar with.

### Source Control Management
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - We use Git for source control. Most of us just use this command line interface. The docs page and quick reference guide of this site will tell you all you'd ever want to know about Git and more.
* [GitHub](https://desktop.github.com/) Our source is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and they provide a desktop application which might be easier to begin with than the Git CLI.
